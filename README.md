# What should I do today?
Check the weather and notify me dude

# OK... what?
Dude... this thing will check the weather for you.  And then it will email you or sms you or something.  I don't know, we'll notify you.  Don't worry about that.  This is just a bunch of code for @whatstin to play with something

# OK cool, how can I do
get node
get npm
get redis http://redis.io/download
run redis
get this app
issue the command:
node server.js
open localhost:3000
get your weather on
